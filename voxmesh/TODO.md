# Mesh dump
- [ ] Explicitly split non-manifold edges (two voxels adjacents by an edge).
- [ ] Add option to normalize vertices positions (vs dumping real-world coords)

# Miscellaneous
- [ ] Use triangle orientation for in/out events.
- [ ] Robust implementation? Raycast from 3 directions, and vote?
- [ ] Add conservative mode where all voxels which intersect a triange get set
- [ ] Vtk output?
